// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

(3+4==7)

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(If number divides evenly then it is even else odd)

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers. (Input n1,n2,n3,n4,n5)   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers. (ave= (n1+n2+n3+n4+n5)/5)
c) Find the smallest and 			largest of the five entered numbers.
(if n1<n2, set min to n1 else set min to n2;	(If n1<n2, set max to n2 else set max to n1;	
If n3<min, set min to n3 else "";		If n3>max, set max to n3 else "";
If n4<min, set min to n4 else "";		if n4>max, set max to n4 else "";
If n5<min, set min to n5 else "")		if n5>max, set max to n5 else "")
			
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are
(Echo "The average is" print ave)
(Echo "min is" print min) (Echo "max is" print max)
